## Explaination:
---

This code creates a webpage that showcases study methods with the following elements and functionality:

`HTML`:

* The HTML sets up a webpage with a container divided into two columns: one for an image and another for text content.
* It includes three buttons labeled "Method 1," "Method 2," and "Method 3" for switching between different study methods.

`CSS`:

* The CSS defines the styling, layout, and responsive design of the webpage.
* It includes hover effects for the image and buttons, making them interactive.
* Media queries adjust the layout for smaller screens.

`JavaScript`:

* The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the webpage.
* It handles button clicks and updates the image and text content based on the selected method.
* An audio sound is played when a button is clicked.
  
In summary, the webpage allows users to explore three different study methods by clicking on buttons, which dynamically update the displayed content and image, creating an interactive and informative educational experience.
